# Bank-Management-System
I made a Bank Management system using C language. In This system you can deposit , withdraw, transfer the money to another bank account or see the details and transactions of  your account.
There are two files, the file with .C extension is the code and the other one with .exe extension is the orignal project.
When you open the bank management system, you first need to Enter,
1>Your name.
2>Account Number

THen the main menu of the system is displayed.
